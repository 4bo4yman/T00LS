<h1>$${\color{red}Introduction}$$</h1>


#### Welcome to Web Enumeration! In this room, we'll be showcasing some of the most fundamental tools used in the enumeration stage of a web target. Good enumeration skills are vital in penetration testing -- how else are you supposed to know what you're targeting?! It is, however, rather easy to fall into rabbit holes.
