ï»¿We don't need to start unrolling the fancy toolkit from the get-go. More often than not, the results of using our own initiative over automated scans bare more results. For example, we may be able to find the "golden ticket" without making all of the noise. Let's outline some fundamentals skills involving you and your browser.

Your browser is as extensive as you are (and some!) and keeps records of the data it receives and who from. We can use this for a range of activities: finding that exact photo or more usefully -- the location of certain files or assets being loaded. This could include things from scripts to page URLs.

#### Using our Browsers Developer Console

Modern-day browsers including Chrome and Firefox have a suite of tools located in the "Developer Tools/Console". We're going to be discussing Firefox's, however, Chrome has a very similar suite. This suite includes a range of tools including:

  1. Viewing page source code
  2. Finding assets
  3. Debugging & executing code such as javascript on the client-side (our Browser)

Using "F12" on our keyboard, this is a shortcut to launch this suite of tools. 

### Inspecting Tool

At first, we can see the web page with the heading "Hi Friend" and a section of the screen filled with the "Inspector" tool. This allows us to view the HTML source code of the webpage we have loaded in our browser. This often contains things such as developer comments, and the name to certain aspects of web page features including forms and the likes. 

Developers often leave behind comments in the form of the <!-- --> tags...for example: <!-- This is a comment --> which are not rendered in the browser as we can see here:
